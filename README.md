# Engima Final Project

This is the final independent project for Mod1.

### Self Assessment

**Functionality** (3)

Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented. Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces successfully implemented

**Object Oriented Programming** (3)

Project is broken into logical components that are appropriately encapsulated. No classes are unreasonably small or large, or contain knowledge/information/behavior that they shouldnâ€™t know about. Student can articulate the single responsibilities of the various components.

**Ruby Conventions and Mechanics** (3)

No classes are over 80 lines and no methods are over 10 lines. Code is properly indented and spaced. Class, method, variable, and file names follow convention. Enumerables were chosen as the most efficient tool for a given job.

**Test Driven Development** (3)

Every method is tested at both the unit and integration level, and completely verify expected behavior. There are tests for random numbers in the key class and tests when using today's date. Utilized stubs when appropriate - mainly used stubs for generating random numbers and using today's date. Test coverage is 100%.

**Version Control** (4)

There are 79 commits and 14 pull requests.
